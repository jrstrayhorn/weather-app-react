Weather App built with React

This is the extra credit curriculum for the ReactTraining/TylerMcGinnis React Fundamentals Course!!!

Our task was to build a weather app using React!! ðŸ¤“

In that course we reviewed:

* NPM
* Babel
* Webpack
* React
* React Router
* Axios
* Firebase Hosting ðŸ”¥

This project used all of those resources including the following:

* HTML5/Bootstrap Template from Creative-Tim
* OpenCage Data Geocoder API for Geocoding Address to Lat/Long
* OpenWeatherMap API for getting the current weather

The finished project can be viewed at https://weatherly-jr.firebaseapp.com
